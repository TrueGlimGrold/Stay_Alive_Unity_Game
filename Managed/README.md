# Overview

I like to fule my learning of computer progamming concepts through game design as I find it quite enjoyable. The reason I wrote such a simple game is because I wanted to start off knowing that I could in fact make a game. If I ever make another one it will likely be more complex. 

In the game "Stay Alive" You are a mobile turret that is trying to protect yourself from the onslaught of alien creatures. Point and click to aim your cannon, and use w,a,s,d or the arrow keys to evade wave after wave of hungy aliens. Each time you kill an alien your score will increase. It is important that you keep your eye on the minimap in the top right corner of the screen, so that you know when to shoot and when to run.

# Development Environment

To develop this code I first made art within Gimp, arranged it in Unity as game assets, and then wrote C# code using visual studio code. For the sound effects, I searched through Pixa bay for open source sound effects that others have allready designed.

# Future work

Here are some concepts for games I might want to make in the future. 

* A 2D action platformer as a village building and defending game. 

* A modification of this game, where rather than dying in one hit. Enemies will contain different enemies, much like the baloons in baloons tower defence. 

* A 2D top down tower defence games where you setup bases, and try to defend from multiple points at the same time, each point being in a different screen view.
